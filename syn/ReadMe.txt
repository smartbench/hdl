Top level file should be in ../top/
PCF file should be in ./

To change the top level, make TOP=<name_without_extension>
The pcf file should have the same name as the top level file.

To synthetise with a fake adc (testing purpose until having the mainboard),
there are two alternatives:
a) loads a signal contained in the file 'rom.hex' into a ROM. To choose this one,
only FAKE_ADC has to be defines.
b) a simple counter. To choose this one, FAKE_ADC and FAKE_ADC_ALT have to be defined.
The defines are added as parameters in the Makefile.
Examples:
make syn DEF=FAKE_ADC
make syn DEF="FAKE_ADC FAKE_ADC_ALT"

To check if the fake adc is correctly set, you can do:
make syn -DEF=FAKE_ADC | grep "FAKE_ADC ON"
